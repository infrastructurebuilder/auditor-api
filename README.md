## The Xpp3 writer generated by the model didn't write out my report's unique ID!

In a hypothetical instance where `java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString()`
experiences a collision, the report ID would not be written to the results file.
Theoretically, this ought not to happen, but it is documented here for the
sake of completeness.
